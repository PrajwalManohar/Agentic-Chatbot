🤖 Agentic AI Chatbot – Modular GenAI Assistant with LangGraph & Groq LLaMA 3
================================================================================
Type: AI-powered Conversational App | Multi-LLM Orchestration | MLOps-Ready
Technologies: LangGraph · LangChain · Streamlit · Groq · LLaMA 3 · OpenAI · FAISS · Python 

🧩 Overview
=================
A highly modular and interactive GenAI assistant built using LangGraph, this chatbot framework supports multiple intelligent use cases including:

🗣️ Basic conversational chatbot

📰 Real-time news collector & summarizer

📄 Long document summarizer with memory

🌐 Web-interactive chatbot with scraping and search capabilities

Deployed through a Streamlit UI, this app integrates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), including Groq’s LLaMA 3 (8B), with dynamic configuration and use-case switching.

💡 Key Features
=================
🔄 **Modular Agent Graphs with LangGraph**
Implemented a state-machine architecture with nodes and edges for task-specific agents: basic conversation, scraping, summarizing, and blogging.

Designed separate nodes using LangGraph to decouple logic, tool usage, and LLM responses.

🧠 **Dynamic LLM Switching**
Allows users to select the LLM provider (Groq/OpenAI) and model (e.g., llama3-8b-8192) from the UI.

Configurable directly from the Streamlit interface—flexible and production-ready.

🧰 **Multi-Tool Agent Integration**
Basic Chatbot Node: General Q&A using Groq/OpenAI models.

News Collector Node: Scrapes headlines and performs abstractive summarization.

Web Tool Node: Combines scraping, question-answering, and summarization over real-time content.

Summarizer Node: Handles long document or transcript summarization using RAG and FAISS.

🗃️ **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
Implemented document retrieval pipeline using FAISS to fetch relevant content chunks for context-enhanced generation.

🧼 **Clean UI and Developer Console**
Developed using Streamlit, providing a simple and intuitive user interface for testing multiple use cases.

Exposes configurations like LLM provider, model, and API key in a safe and user-friendly way.
